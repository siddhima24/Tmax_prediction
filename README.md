Seven meteorological variables
at daily scale, are considered input to the model (Table 1).
These are lagged (previous 4  days) values of outgoing
longwave radiation (W/m2), relative humidity, resultant of
zonal and meridional wind speed (m/s), sea level pressure
(kPa) and rainfall (mm), maximum temperature (°C), and
solar radiation (J/m2
). In addition, month index, i.e., 1 for
January, 2 for February, is also used as an input. Out of
these variables, rainfall and maximum temperature values
are observed records, converted to gridded products with
a spatial resolution of 0.25° (latitude)×0.25° (longitude)
and 1° (latitude)×1° (longitude), respectively.
